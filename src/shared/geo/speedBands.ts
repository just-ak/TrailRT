/**
 * Speed distribution: what proportion of a route is at each speed.
 *
 * Three rules from ADR 0011 are enforced here rather than in the UI, because a
 * display-layer rule is one refactor away from being lost:
 *
 * 1. **Weighted by distance, not point count.** Sample spacing is not uniform —
 *    a recorded track clusters samples where the recorder moved slowly — so a
 *    point-count percentage would systematically over-weight exactly the slow
 *    sections it claims to measure.
 * 2. **Unknown is a band.** Distance whose speed could not be determined is
 *    reported at its true size, never redistributed across the known bands.
 *    ADR 0018 allows one exception, decided by the caller: a UK road with a
 *    known class may carry the statutory default, marked `assumed`, and every
 *    band then reports how much of it is assumed. Given that OpenStreetMap speed-limit
 *    coverage is partial, this band is often the largest, and that is the
 *    correct answer rather than an embarrassing one.
 * 3. **Posted limit and recorded speed are separate series.** This module does
 *    not know which it is given; the caller labels it. They are never summed
 *    into one distribution.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free, so the arithmetic is testable without Electron.
