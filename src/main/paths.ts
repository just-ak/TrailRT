 * Must run before `app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` and before the app is
 * ready. Two reasons, both learned the hard way:
 *
 * - The single-instance lock is scoped to the user data directory. Setting the
 *   path afterwards means every instance locks the *default* directory, so two
 *   runs with different data directories still fight over one lock.
 * - Chromium creates its own caches under the user data path during startup.
 *   Moving the path later leaves those directories behind in the wrong place
 *   and logs "Failed to create directory" errors.
