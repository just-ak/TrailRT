/**
 * Native JSON collection reader.
 *
 * ## Identifiers are remapped, not reused
 *
 * Every imported object gets a fresh UUID, and internal references are
 * rewritten consistently. This makes import a **merge**: bringing a collection
 * onto a machine that already has data cannot overwrite an existing object
 * that happens to share an id, and importing the same file twice gives two
 * copies rather than a silent half-overwrite.
 *
 * The alternative — honouring the stored ids — would make the operation a
 * partial restore with no warning about what it replaced. If a user wants an
 * exact restore, the SQLite snapshot in `backupService` is the tool for that,
 * and it says plainly that it replaces everything.
 *
 * ## Everything or nothing
 *
 * The whole apply runs in one transaction. A collection that fails halfway
 * leaves no folders, no trips and no orphaned geometry.
