 * Resolves the configured routing provider, or explains why there isn't one.

 * This is the single place that turns settings into a `RoutingProvider`, and
 * the single place that enforces consent. Every outbound routing call in the
 * application goes through here, so "is the user's geometry allowed to leave
 * this machine" is answered once rather than at each call site.
 *
 * ## Three ways there is no provider, and they are different answers
 *
 * - **Not configured.** The default. The application is fully usable: routes
 *   are drawn as straight lines exactly as they were in Phases 1–3. This is
 *   not an error and must not be presented as one.
 * - **Invalid endpoint.** Something is configured but fails the origin policy.
 *   The user needs to fix a specific thing, so the policy's own message is
 *   carried through rather than flattened.
 * - **Consent not given.** Configured and valid, but the user has not yet
 *   agreed to send geometry to that host. The UI can offer the consent prompt;
 *   anything else would be asking for forgiveness instead of permission.
 *
 * Collapsing these into "routing unavailable" would leave the user with no idea
 * which of three quite different things to do about it.
