 * moving a track's points onto a road, because a recording is measured data,
 * and nothing in this file writes to `track_points` or `route_points`.
 *
 * ## Two speed series that never merge
 *
 * A **posted limit** is an attribute of the road, available for routes and
 * tracks alike once matched. A **recorded speed** comes from a track's own
 * timestamps and exists only where it has them. They are different facts with
 * different reliability, so they are computed by different functions, labelled
 * at the boundary, and never summed into one distribution. ADR 0011 §1.
